- 👋 Hi, I’m @jonteague, funnily enough my real name is also Jon Teague
- 👴 I'm old enough to have sent software written in COBOL on paper to the typing pool and have it come back as a stack of punched cards
- 👀 I’m interested mostly in Raspberry Pi programming projects, with Python, espcially making things move or lights flash
- 👔 Professionally my software engineering was mostly using Pascal, Modula-2, C & C++ but now I do project managment and it's years since anyone has been stupid enough to let me write real code that does real stuff 😂
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Italian
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting sanity into UK politics (ha! fat chance)
- 📫 How to reach me ... seance anyone? OK, emailing github@teague.me.uk is probably more reliable
